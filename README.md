This repository should contain all that is needed to reproduce the results presented in my thesis. 

All the code was written using Python version 3.7.7. 
All python libraries used will be listed at the top of each python file and not all libraries were updated throughout the course of the project. 
This could cause some issues, particularly with newer versions of SciPy, NumPy and Pandas outdating some functions.

Data, where it is not generated, is located in Excel spreadsheets found alongside the Python code for each chapter.
